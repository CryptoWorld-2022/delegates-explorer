## System Requirements

*The explorer is optional for delegates to run, as the network nodes will run it already.*

To run the delegates explorer, it needs to be on the same server as an X-Cash node. The system requirements for running a node are in the [`xcash-dpops`](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops/tree/master#system-requirements) repository.

> At the moment, [`xcash-dpops`](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops/) is only available for Linux/Unix distributions.

## Installation Process

### Dependencies

> The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to run the delegates explorer.

| Dependencies | Min. version   | Ubuntu package                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

**If you want to run the website using SSL then you will need to install a webserver like nginx  
The readme shows you how to setup the website using HTTP, since there is no sensitive data in the website**

### Requirements

#### Intalling Node.js from binaries

> It is recommended to install the nodejs folder in the home directory `/home/$USER/` or root directory (`/root/`) in a new folder

To download, go to the Node.js official [release page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and download the **Linux Binaries**. Copy it to your deisgnated folder and run these commands:

```bash
tar -xf node*.tar.xz
rm node*.tar.xz
```

Then add Node.js to your path:

```bash
echo -e '\nexport PATH=path_to_nodejs/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
```
> Replace `path_to_nodejs/bin` with the location of the `bin` folder where you installed Node.js

#### npm

> Note if your installing on a `root` session, you need to run these additional commands before upgrading
> ```bash
> npm config set user 0
> npm config set unsafe-perm true
> ```

Update `npm` globally:
```bash
npm install -g npm
```

#### angular

Install the latest version of Angular globally:
```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

Then install the compressor `UglifyJS` globally :
```shell
npm install -g uglify-js
```

### Install

#### Clone repository

In your desired folder, clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/X-CASH-official/delegates-explorer.git
```

#### Install dependencies

```shell
cd delegates-explorer
npm install
```

#### Configure application

Edit the `delegates-explorer/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` , set your Base-URL (Domain URL) and if needed an external API Endpoint:

```
export const environment = {
    baseURL: "http://delegates.your-domain.tld",
    apiEndPoint: ''
};
```

#### Install the firewall with parameters for shared delegates.

Run `bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops/master/scripts/autoinstaller/autoinstaller.sh)"` and choose `12 = Shared Delegates Firewall`.

#### Manual Installation of the firewall

Download the [`firewall_script.sh`](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops/tree/master/scripts/firewall) .

Uncomment these lines in `firewall_script.sh` to enable port 80 and redirect port 80 to 18283:
```
# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 100 --connlimit-mask 32 -j DROP
# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 18283 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 100 --connlimit-mask 32 -j DROP
```
```
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

Run the firewall script
`./firewall_script.sh`

#### Build

To build the delegate explorer, go to the `delegates-explorer` folder and run:
```shell
npm run build
```

It will build in the `dist`folder.

Compress the `.js` files with `Uglify-JS` and move all of the contents of this folder to your `xcash-dpops/` folder

```shell
cd dist
for f in *.js; do echo "Processing $f file.."; uglifyjs $f --compress --mangle --output "{$f}min"; rm $f; mv "{$f}min" $f; done
rm -r ~/xcash-dpops/delegates-explorer
mkdir ~/xcash-dpops/delegates-explorer
cd ../
cp -a dist/* ~/xcash-dpops/delegates-explorer/
```

### Testing

```shell
npm test
```

To test that you have properly configured the delegates explorer, run `xcash-dpops` with the `--test_data_add` flag. *This will add test datas to the MongoDB.*

Now run the website server again using the normal options.

Next, navigate to your servers IP address or website domain. You should now see the website and some test data. You can navigate through the website using the test data.

When you have verified that the website works correctly, remove the test data by shutting down the `xcash-dpops` and then running it again with the `--test_data_remove` flag.
